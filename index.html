            <p>Howzat fantasy app is an online fantasy sports/game platform where you can create a virtual cricket team
                of
                11 players from an upcoming real-life match. The main objective in fantasy leagues is to score as many
                points as possible and achieve a winning position on the rankings board on the fantasy app.</p>
            <p>Fantasy cricket is not just a game of luck, it is a game of skill which requires proper analysis and
                knowledge of the sport. A good understanding of the game and a little bit of research can help you in
                the
                selection of the best XI for the
                fantasy league and win regularly. The factors to consider while choosing the players include the pitch
                and
                weather conditions, the current form of the players and toss. For example, good batting conditions
                suggest
                that the batters will
                likely gather the maximum points. Similarly, a bowler friendly pitch will demand taking more bowlers in
                your
                fantasy team.</p>

                <li>

                        of course, depends on several factors as it’s a real-match scenario.

                    <p>Kabaddi as a sport is gaining popularity on a global stage, and so does the fantasy kabaddi too.

                        kabaddi
                        brings you close to the action. Fantasy kabaddi rules and regulations are slightly different
                        from the
                        original game.</p>
                    <p>
                        Kabaddi is played between two teams of 7 players (unlike 11 in cricket/football). One of the
                        basic
                        rules of kabaddi is for a "raider," to go into the opposing team's half, touch out as many of
                        their
                        defenders as possible, and return to their own half
                        in a single breath. Points are scored for each player touched by the raider, while the opposing
                        team
                        defenders earn points for stopping the raider.

The result of a match or competition in a game of skill depends mainly on the player’s skill, expertise, knowledge and understanding of the game. Skill is the predominant factor in the outcome of the game, instead of luck or chance.The Hon’ Supreme Court of India has ruled that it is legal to play skill games for real money, as well as for free, in India. However, the state laws of Assam, Odisha, Sikkim, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana prohibit the residents of these states from playing cash games online. But the residents of all other Indian states and union territories can play fantasy sports for real money online and the money they win in skill games online is considered their legal income. However, people aged under 18 are not eligible to participate in cash fantasy contests as they are prohibited from playing cash games by Indian law."
